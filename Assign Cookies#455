//here i have solved the assign cookies problem(problem number-455)

/* I have used The Two Pointer approcah to solve this problem
     Explanation- So Initially we sort both the vectors
                  then we initialize two pointers counter1 and counter2 with 0
                  we run a loop which will terminate whichever vector(g or s) is traversed first
                  initially both the counters check the 0th index
                  if the greed of the element in g is satisfied by the element in s both the counters are incremented to next index
                  if not then the size of coookie(s pointer) is incremented and checked if the present value of the cookie satisfies the greed if not then again s pointer++ if yes then s pointer++ and g pointer++
                  at the end of the loop the counter1 that is the number of count of the greed vector is returned as the value for nuymber of children satisfied

//code-
class Solution {
public:
    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        sort(g.begin(),g.end());
        sort(s.begin(),s.end());
        //using the two pointer approach
        int counter1=0;
        int counter2=0;
        while(counter2<s.size() && counter1<g.size())
        {
            if(s[counter2]>=g[counter1])
            {
                counter1++;
                counter2++;
            }
            else
            {
                counter2++;
            }
        }
        return counter1;
    }
